Big-Data-Activity-Recognition-Classification-
This project aims to address classification tasks by utilizing predictive analysis on sensor data produced by a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). We will categorize user activities, such as bending, sitting, cycling, by interpreting the intricate patterns found in the WSN data. This focus on activity classification sets the stage for applications beyond simple data analysis, paving the way for personalized user experiences and optimized system responses.

AReM Dataset Overview:

Purpose: Designed as a benchmark for Activity Recognition applications utilizing a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN).
Task: Predict user activity from time-series RSS data generated by WSN nodes.
Data Source: RSS measurements from IRIS nodes (IEEE 802.15.4 standard) on the user's chest and ankles, using a modified Spin token-passing protocol.
Sampling: 5 RSS samples per epoch (20 Hz) for each of the three node pairs (Chest-Right Ankle, Chest-Left Ankle, Right Ankle-Left Ankle).
Features: Mean and standard deviation of RSS readings for each node pair.
Epoch Duration: 250 milliseconds.
Dataset Composition: 480 sequences of input RSS data, with 15 temporal sequences per activity, totaling 42240 instances.
Activities: Includes standard activities and two types of bending activities as specified in additional documentation.
